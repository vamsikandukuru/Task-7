# Task 7: Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

**Objective:** Learn to spot and remove potentially harmful browser extensions.

**Tools Used:** Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge

---

## Overview
Some browser extensions, even those available on official web stores, can turn malicious after updates. Cybercriminals can insert harmful code into previously safe extensions, known as **"sleeper agents"**, which later activate to perform malicious actions.

### How These Sleeper Agent Extensions Work
When activated, these extensions:
1. Capture the URL of the page being visited.
2. Send it to a remote server with a unique user ID.
3. Receive potential redirect instructions from a Command & Control (C&C) server.
4. Automatically redirect the browser if instructed.

## Why This Is Dangerous
Even official web store extensions are not always safe, although they undergo automated and manual safety checks. The risk is even higher when installing extensions from outside official stores.

## Recommended Actions if Found
1. **Clear all browsing data** (history, cookies, cache, site data).
2. **Monitor accounts** for suspicious activity, especially sensitive accounts like online banking.
3. **Change passwords** for accounts accessed while the extension was installed.
4. **Enable two-factor authentication (2FA)** for additional security.
5. **Reset browser settings** to default.
6. **Watch for suspicious browser behavior** like unexpected redirects or changed search engines.
7. **Keep browsers and extensions updated** to patch vulnerabilities.
8. **Run a full system scan** with Malwarebytes to detect and remove infections.

## Final Advice
If an extension suddenly requests **new permissions** after an update, carefully review them. If the permissions seem unnecessary for the extensionâ€™s function, remove it immediately.
