# Task 7: Identify & Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions (Brave Browser)

> **Cyber Hygiene Check** – Because even your browser can be a spy.

---

##  Overview
Browser extensions can be incredibly helpful… until they’re not.  
Some start out harmless but later receive malicious updates – turning into **sleeper agents** that:
-  Track every website you visit  
-  Send data to remote servers  
-  Redirect your browser without your consent  

This project documents how I scanned my **Brave Browser** extensions, verified them using [CRXplorer](https://crxplorer.com), and ensured no suspicious add-ons were lurking.
